Description: output spool reader for suricata and snort
 This program decouples output overhead from the Suricata/Snort network 
 intrusion detection system and allows Snort to run at full speed. It
 takes input and output plugins and can therefore be used to convert
 almost any spooled file. This version is compiled with mysql support
 only.
